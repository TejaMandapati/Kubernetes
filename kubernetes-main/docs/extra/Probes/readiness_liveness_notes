Readiness probes:

Sometimes, applications are temporarily unable to serve traffic.
For example, an application might need to load large data or configuration files during startup.
In such cases, you don't want to kill the application, but you don't want to send it requests either.
Kubernetes provides readiness probes to detect and mitigate these situations.
