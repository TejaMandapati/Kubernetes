In a Kubernetes cluster, the quorum size refers to the number of nodes that must be available in order for the cluster to continue functioning properly. The quorum size is determined by the size of the cluster and the level of fault tolerance required.

The quorum size is calculated using the following formula:

quorum size = (number of master nodes / 2) + 1

In this formula, the number of master nodes refers to the number of nodes in the cluster that are configured as masters. Typically, a Kubernetes cluster will have an odd number of master nodes to ensure that a quorum can be formed in the event of a failure.

For example, if a Kubernetes cluster has 5 master nodes, the quorum size would be calculated as:

quorum size = (5 / 2) + 1
quorum size = 2.5 + 1
quorum size = 3
