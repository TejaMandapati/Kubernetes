#DEPLOYMENT  
A Kubernetes Deployment tells Kubernetes how to create or modify instances of the pods that hold a containerized application. Deployments can help to efficiently scale the number of replica pods, enable the rollout of updated code in a controlled manner, or roll back to an earlier deployment version if necessary.
